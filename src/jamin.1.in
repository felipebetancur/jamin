.TH JAMIN "1" @VERSION@ "January 2004" "Audio"
.SH "NAME"
jamin \- JACK Audio Mastering interface

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBjamin\fR [\fI options \fR] [\fI inport1 inport2\fR [\fI outport1
outport2\fR ]]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBjamin\fR command invokes JAMin, the JACK Audio Mastering
interface which is based on the JACK Audio Connection Kit,
<\fBhttp://jackit.sourceforge.net\fR>.

JAMin is designed for professional stereo audio mastering.  It
provides of a number of tools: a 1024-band hand-drawn EQ with
parametric controls, a 31-band graphic EQ, 3-band compressor, 3-band
stereo width control, lookahead limiter, boost, and other features.

For the latest JAMin information, see
<\fBhttp://jamin.sourceforge.net\fR>.

.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP 
\fB\-f\fR \fIfilename\fR
.br 
Load session file \fIfilename\fR on startup.  If no session file is
specified, JAMin loads "~/.jamin/default.jam" if that exists, or
else uses some system-provided default settings.
.TP 
\fB\-h\fR
.br 
Print a brief usage message describing the main \fBjamin\fR options,
including some developer options not intended for normal users.
.TP 
\fB\-n\fR \fIclientname\fR
.br 
Set JACK \fIclientname\fR used to identify input and output ports.
Otherwise, use "JAMin".
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR
.br 
Don't automatically connect any JACK output ports.  Otherwise, connect
to "alsa_pcm:playback_1" and "alsa_pcm:playback_2".
.TP 
\fB\-v\fR
.br 
Print verbose output.  Use \fB\-vv\fR or \fB\-vvv\fR for more detail.
.TP 
\fB\-V\fR
Print version and copyright information, then quit.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B ~/.jamin
Directory containing per-user JAMin data.  Created automatically if
it does not already exist.
.TP
.B ~/.jamin/jamin_ui
Definitions for GTK user interface customization.  An empty jamin_ui
file causes GTK to use its system defaults.  If this file does not
exist, JAMin uses ${prefix}/share/jamin/examples/jamin_ui.  If you
want to customize that file, copy it to ~/.jamin/jamin_ui and make
changes there.
.TP
.B ~/.jamin/*.jam
Normal location for user-defined session files.  They can be stored
elsewhere, if desired.
.TP
.B ~/.jamin/default.jam
If this session file exists, it is loaded by default on startup, except
when overridden by the \fB\-f\fR option.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP 
Since \fBjamin\fR is not a standalone program we generally need other
programs to provide input audio and receive the mastered output.  This
example uses \fBalsaplayer\fR with output going to the first two ALSA
playback ports:

.IP 
\fBjackd \-R \-d alsa \-p 2048 \-r 44100 &\fR
.br 
\fBalsaplayer -o jack \-s src \-d noconnect song.wav &\fR
.br 
\fBjamin src:out_1 src:out_2\fR
.br 

.PP
That was the brute force method.  It is much easier to have
\fBqjackctl\fR start the JACK server and handle its connections.
After the server is running, start \fBjackplayer\fR and \fBjamin\fR.
The "transport" option tells \fBjackplayer\fR (an \fBalsaplayer\fR
alias) to start and stop under JACK transport control.

.br 
.IP 
\fBqjackctl &\fR
.br 
\fBjackplayer \-d noconnect/transport song.wav &\fR
.br 
\fBjamin\fR
.PP 
Any JACK-aware player such as \fBrezound\fR, \fBecasound\fR or
\fBecamegapedal\fR can be used, instead.

.PP
A more advanced technique uses \fBardour\fR for both the source and
destination.  In \fBardour\fR, run all of your track outputs into a
stereo bus, connect its output ports to JAMin, then run the JAMin
outputs back into a record-enabled stereo track.  This allows mixing
and mastering at the same time.  If JAMin is already running when
\fBardour\fR reopens the session, it will automatically reconnect all
these ports.
