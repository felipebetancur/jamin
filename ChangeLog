	  output destination.  Now works with any driver, not just ALSA.

	* process.c (run_eq): linked UI controls to bypass for EQ and limiter

	* process.c (process_set_eq_bypass, process_set_limiter_bypass):
	  new functions, used to control bypass from other threads.

2004-02-17  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* process.c (run_eq): fixed off-by-one-octave bug in frequency ->
	  bin mappings

2004-01-27  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>

	* process.c (process, run_eq): added functions to control
	  active/mute/byapss state of each crossover band

	* process.h: added macros for band states

2004-01-18  Steve Harris  <steve@plugin.org.uk>
